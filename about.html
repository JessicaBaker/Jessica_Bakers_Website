        I have always been intrested in photography. Since I was a child, the art of taking photos has facinated me. As I got older I deceided to pursue my passion. This lead me to enroll in an Interactive Multimeadia class at Central Tech in Drumright, Oklahoma. In that class I learned how to properly take photos and was taught the the skills I needed to become a skilled photographer. I have photographed a variety of subjects, including animals, people, and landscapes. I find that I have a passion for photographing uncommon subjects and have a knack for showing things from a different perspective. I also enjoy taking portraits of people and their pets.
